The work developed in this course consisted of 3 labs. Each one has a corresponding Jupyter Notebook which you can explore to recreate our experiments. Labs 2 and 3 are also accompanied by an explanatory report.

# Lab 1: Speech signal processing #

Final grade: 19.00/20

In this lab we experimented with different techniques for extracting information from and manipulating speech signals.

# Lab 2: Speech signal classification #

Final grade: 20.00/20

In this lab we developed a model which classifies audios into one of six target languages.

# Lab 3: Dialogue system #

Final grade: 17.00/20

In this lab we developed a dialogue system, which receives pre-recorded audios and speaks back in a dialogue manner, i.e., bearing in mind the context of the conversation so far.
